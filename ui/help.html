	<p>
	Two major properties of a voice
	which influence how it is gendered
	are <strong>pitch</strong>,
	the frequency at which your vocal folds vibrate,
	and <strong>resonance</strong>,
	the size of the passages the air travels through.
	<!--
	<ul>
		<li>Pitch is the frequency at which the object emitting a sound vibrates.
		In voices, this will be the vocal folds.

		<li>Resonance is the effect exerted on a sound by the passage it travels through.
		In voices, the passage is the vocal tract.
	</ul>
	<p>
	Testosterone tends to thicken the vocal folds and lengthen the vocal tract,
	resulting in lower pitch and darker resonance.
	Therefore, most people read voices with these features as male or masculine.
	-->

	<p>
	If you want to feminize your voice,
	you'll probably want to raise your pitch and resonance,
	taking your voice closer to the 
	<span style="color: #FDCFC8; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 0px 0px 1px red">top-right</span> corner of the graph.
	If you want to masculinize your voice,
	you should target the <span style="color: #054EC4; font-weight: bold">bottom-left</span> corner.

	If you want your voice to sound more androgynous,
	you should target either 
	the <span style="color: #b48ead; font-weight: bold">center</span>, or one of the 
	<span style="color: #DBD9EC; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 0px 0px 1px blue">top-left</span>
	or <span style="color: #833047; font-weight: bold;">bottom-right</span> corners.

	<p>
	There is no specific threshold in either pitch or resonance 
	at which a voice will always be gendered male or female,
	and typical values differ by language, dialect, age,
	and a variety of other factors.
	This tool should be used to explore your own voice
	to find your way to a voice that suits you.
	It does not attempt to show you whether your voice "passes."
