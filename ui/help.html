	This app visualizes the pitch and resonance of voices in recordings over time.
	<strong>Pitch</strong> is our perception of the frequency at which the vocal folds vibrate.
	<strong>Resonance</strong> is the effect exerted on a sound by the passage the air travels through.
	The program plots recordings in a <strong>2-dimensional space</strong>,
	where the Y-axis represents pitch,
	and the X-axis represents resonance,
	with brighter sounds represented with a higher percentage.
	</p>
	

	<p>Typically, voices perceived as female have brighter resonance and higher pitch (top right),
	while those perceived as male have darker resonance and lower pitch (bottom left).
	These features can be blended in different degrees
	to create a <strong>broad spectrum</strong> of perceptual and aesthetic qualities related to gender.
	There are no sharp cutoffs at which a voice is 
	guaranteed to be gendered a specific way,
	just as the colors in the graph blend seamlessly into one another.

	<p>Press the <strong>play button</strong> in the top-left corner of the app to play the clip
	associated with the selected point on the graph.
	Examine some of the provided examples to get a sense
	of how positions on the graph correspond to your perceptions of gender.
	You can visualize your own recordings by pressing the <strong>add clip button</strong>
	in the top-right and submitting a recording.
	It will take some time to process,
	so you may wish to examine the other clips while the recording is processed.

	<p>Your clips are sent to our server for processing,
	but they are <strong>not stored persistently</strong>.
	You can save the sound file from your recording
	using the <strong>download button</strong> in the "Details" tab.
	From the settings tab,
	you can also <strong>export</strong> all of your data in a single file
	which can be imported for viewing at another time.
	Otherwise, your data will be lost when you exit the page.

	<p>We hope that using this program will help you understand how voices are gendered
	and assess your own progress if you are trying to alter your voice
	to better match your gender identity or desired presentation. Good luck!
