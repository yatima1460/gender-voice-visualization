		I am afraid to own a Body—

		And God, for a Frontier."

		From childhood's hour I have not been
		As others were — I have not seen
		As others saw — I could not bring
		My passions from a common spring —
		From the same source I have not taken
		My sorrow — I could not awaken
		My heart to joy at the same tone —
		And all I lov'd — I lov'd alone."
